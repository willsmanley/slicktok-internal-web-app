# Mojo Web App

We are going to be using TypeScript.

We are going to be using `react-snap` to pre-render static pages for the external site.

Save all `.svg` files to `/src/assets/svgs`, then run:
```
npm run svgr
```
That will compile all of the SVGs into nice TypeScript files that can be imported directly.
